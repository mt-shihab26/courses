## 02. Warm-up

-   Topics
    -   [x] Bit Masking
    -   [x] 2's Complement
    -   [x] Subarrays, Subsequences and Substrings
-   Notes
    -   `int` capacity: `-2 * 10^9` to `2 * 10^9`
    -   `long long int` capacity: `-9 * 10^18` to `9 * 10^18`
    -   `10^8` operation -> `1second`
    -   `10^10` operation -> `10^10/10^8` or `100seconds`
    -   `n << k` -> `n * 2^k`
    -   `n >> k` -> `n / 2^k`
    -   2'complement of `~N` = `-((~(~N))+1)` = `-(N+1)`
    -   positive integers: `>= 1` and non-negative integers: `>=0`
