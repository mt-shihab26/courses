LWS think in a redux way paid course

## React one-way data flow

-  Our application had 3 parts - `state`, view and action
-  `State` is the source of truth that drives our app
-  `View` is the declarative description of the ui based on the current state
-   `Action` are the event that occur in the app based on user input and trigger updates in the state.
-   This is called one-way data flow
-   `View` -> `Action` -> `State`

## What is `Redux`?

- `Redux` is a flexible State Container for JavaScript Apps that manages our application state separately
