# Designing Databases

## Data Modeling

- Understand the requirements
- Build a Conceptual Model
- Build a Logical Model
- Build a Physical Model

## Conceptual Model

- Represents the entities and their relationships
- For visualize this model we can use
    - Entity Relationship (ER)
        - draw.io
    - UML Diagram

## Logical Model

- We have three basic relationships
    - One to One
    - One to Many
    - Many to Many

## Physical Model

- A specific model for specific database

## Primary Keys

## Foreign Keys

- Foreign Key Constraints

## Normalization

- Revisiting the models design to reduce data redundancy
- There is 7 normalization rules
    - 1st normal form
        - Each cell should have a single value and we cannot have repeated columns
        - Link table or Pivot table
    - 2nd normal form
    - 3th normal form
