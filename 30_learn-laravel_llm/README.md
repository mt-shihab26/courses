## **1. Laravel Basics (Foundation Layer)**

Before you touch production-scale concepts, you need a strong grasp of the basics.

### **Environment & Setup**

* PHP fundamentals (OOP, namespaces, interfaces, traits, exceptions)
* Install PHP 8+, Composer, Laravel installer
* Directory structure & Laravel request lifecycle
* Config files & `.env` environment variables

### **Routing & Controllers**

* Basic routing & route parameters
* Route groups, prefixes, and middleware
* Controller basics, resource controllers
* API resource routes

### **Blade & Views**

* Blade syntax & template inheritance
* Components & slots
* Conditionals & loops in Blade
* Laravel Mix / Vite for asset bundling

### **Models & Eloquent ORM**

* Defining models & migrations
* CRUD with Eloquent
* Relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, polymorphic)
* Accessors, mutators, and casting

### **Validation & Requests**

* Form requests & validation rules
* Custom validation rules
* Handling validation errors gracefully

---

## **2. Intermediate Laravel (Application Layer)**

Here you start building **real-world app structure**.

### **Authentication & Authorization**

* Laravel Breeze / Jetstream / Fortify
* Guards & providers
* Gates & policies for authorization
* Role & permission management (spatie/laravel-permission)

### **Advanced Eloquent**

* Query scopes (local & global)
* Eager loading & lazy loading
* Chunking & cursor pagination
* Raw queries & query builder

### **API Development**

* API resources & transformers
* Pagination, sorting, filtering best practices
* API versioning strategy
* Rate limiting & throttling

### **File Storage**

* Local & cloud (S3, DigitalOcean Spaces)
* File uploads & downloads
* Image optimization & resizing

### **Queues & Jobs**

* Using queues for background tasks
* Queue drivers (database, Redis, SQS)
* Failed job handling & retries

### **Mail & Notifications**

* Sending emails (SMTP, Mailgun, SES)
* Markdown mail templates
* Notification channels (SMS, Slack, database)

---

## **3. Advanced Laravel (Scalability Layer)**

Now we enter **large-scale app territory**.

### **Architecture & Best Practices**

* Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts in Laravel
* Service classes & action classes
* Repository pattern for database abstraction
* Event sourcing & CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
* Modular monolith & package development

### **Security**

* CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection
* Mass assignment & guarded attributes
* Hashing & encryption
* API authentication with Sanctum / Passport
* Secure file handling & signed URLs

### **Performance Optimization**

* Caching (config, routes, queries, data)
* Redis / Memcached integration
* Queue optimization for high load
* Database indexing & optimization
* Octane for high-concurrency apps
* Optimizing Blade & asset loading

### **Testing**

* Unit testing with PHPUnit
* Feature testing
* HTTP testing
* Mocking & dependency injection in tests
* Pest for simpler testing syntax
* Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

---

## **4. Production & Deployment (Enterprise Layer)**

Now we prepare for **real-world production apps**.

### **DevOps & Deployment**

* Version control best practices (GitFlow, trunk-based)
* Envoy for Laravel deployment scripts
* Dockerizing Laravel apps
* CI/CD pipelines
* Server configuration (Nginx, PHP-FPM)
* Supervisord for queue workers

### **Monitoring & Logging**

* Laravel Telescope for debugging
* Centralized logging (Papertrail, Logstash, ELK)
* Error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)
* Health checks & uptime monitoring

### **Scalability**

* Horizontal scaling with load balancers
* Database replication & read/write splitting
* Cache clustering with Redis Sentinel
* Queue scaling
* API Gateway & microservice integration

### **Maintenance & Good Practices**

* Database migrations in production
* Zero-downtime deployments
* API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
* Versioning & deprecation strategies
* Regular security audits

---

## **5. Continuous Improvement (Mastery Layer)**

Once you have production-ready skills, you focus on **long-term excellence**.

* Contributing to Laravel core & packages
* Building reusable Laravel packages
* Laravel internals deep dive (container, service providers)
* Advanced testing: mutation testing, load testing
* Event-driven microservices with Laravel
* Serverless Laravel (Vapor, Bref)

## **Suggested Learning Path**

1. **Basics** → Build a small blog app
2. **Intermediate** → Build a feature-rich dashboard
3. **Advanced** → Implement DDD & modular structure in a complex API
4. **Production** → Deploy on cloud (AWS/DigitalOcean) with CI/CD
5. **Mastery** → Optimize, scale, and monitor like a pro
