## 15 pointers

-   This pointers complexly type less And complexly useless. This is the simples pointer you can write
-   Type do not matter, Types help to manipulation of that memory
-   We don't know a pointer how much data it's pointing to because it's not holding data right. A pointer is just an integer which is memory address that's it.

## 84 lvalues and rvalues

-   An lvalue refers to an object that persists beyond a single expression.
-   An rvalue is a temporary value that does not persist beyond the expression that uses it.
