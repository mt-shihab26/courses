# Class 03 - Arrays & Strings (August 09, 2021)

## Long Contest
* Title: S2-M3: Synapse Beginner Long 3 [Arrays & Strings, Implementation]
* Link: https://vjudge.net/contest/452362
<!-- * Pass: `thanos` -->

Please try to read and approach as many problems as you can. I'll probably discuss 1-2 problems from here in the next class.
Happy Coding

## Reading Materials and more:
These are the problems I was planning to discuss today. Some of which are covered and I'm leaving the rest as your tasks. Please try to solve the problems along with the long contest:-

### Covered problems:
* [x] [Print the length of a string](Class-Code/01-Print-the-length-of-a-string.cpp)
* [x] [Print the reverse string](Class-Code/02-Print-the-reverse-string.cpp)
* [x] [Cut in the middle and reverse](Class-Code/03-Cut-in-the-middle-and-reverse.cpp)
* [x] [Check if a string is a palindrome or not](Class-Code/04-Check-if-a-string-is-a-palindrome-or-not.cpp)
* [x] [Check if a string/char frequency can be converted to a palindrome or not](Class-Code/07-Check-if-a-string-char-frequency-be-converted-to-a-palindrome-or-not.cpp)
* [x] [Check if two strings are anagrams](Class-Code/05-Check-if-two-strings-are-anagrams.cpp)
* [x] [Check if one string is a subsequence of another (with queries as well)](Class-Code/06-Check-if-on-string-is-a-subsequence-of-another.cpp)

### Tasks:
* [x] [Given two strings, print the lexicographically smaller string](Class-Code/08-Given-two-strings-print-the-lexicographically-smaller-string.cpp)
* [ ] Remove minimum chars to make a palindrome (DP)
* [ ] Maximum sub-array sum (DP)
* [ ] Print sub-array sum(single vs multiple query)
* [ ] Check if two strings are prefix/suffix of one-another
* [ ] Longest palindromic substring
