* https://www.codechef.com/wiki/tutorial-dynamic-programming
* [x] http://www.shafaetsplanet.com/?p=1022 (the first link of DP series, check all of them one by one)

The topics you should practice more on in beginner phase: 0-1 Knapsack, Coin Change, SubsetSum, LIS, LCS
If you like the top-down dp then practice more on backtracking. There's no known limitation for dynamic programming. So, don't limit yourself as well.

Happy Coding (:
